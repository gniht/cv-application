# A Basic CV App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

I'm creating this as a practice exercise to learn more about React, so I will be focusing on functionality and probably won't do much work styling.

### Intended Features

1.  A section to add general information like name, email, phone number.

2.  A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)

3.  A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

#### Learning Goals

I want to: 

1.  Get better at building reusable components.

2.  Learn how to better manage state in functional components.
